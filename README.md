# Datamole's React / TypeScript assignment

Link to the repository where this assigment was created: [datamole-ai/assignments-reactassignment](https://github.com/datamole-ai/assignments-reactassignment) 

### New npm packages:
* [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
* [express-rate-limit](https://github.com/nfriedly/express-rate-limit)

### Tasks not done:
* Add story/stories for `Layout`, ListItem component - I haven't used storybook yet and didn't know how to implement it quickly. I would have needed additional hours to learn it first.
* modify the `Form` component (and related ones if needed) so the form field handles not only string, but also number and treat empty string input as `undefiened - Honestly, I wasn't sure how I should have approached this task.
